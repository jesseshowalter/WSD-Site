			<h3>The Man</h3>
			<article id="the_man">
				<p>Harry Houdini (born Erik Weisz, later Ehrich Weiss or Harry Weiss; March 24, 1874 â€“ October 31, 1926) was a Hungarian-born American <strong>stunt performer</strong>, noted for his sensational <strong>escape acts</strong>. He first attracted notice as Handcuff Harry, on a tour of Europe, where he would sensationally challenge different police-forces to try to keep him locked up. This revealed a talent for gimmickry and for audience involvement that would characterise all his work. Soon he was extending his repertoire to include chains, ropes slung from skyscrapers, straitjackets under water, and having to hold his breath inside a sealed milk-can.</p>

				<p>In 1904, thousands watched as he tried to escape from a special handcuff commissioned by London's Daily Mirror, keeping them in suspense for an hour. Another stunt saw him buried alive and only just able to claw himself to the surface, emerging in a state of near-breakdown. While many suspected that these escapes were fabricated, it is ironic that Houdini was meanwhile presenting himself as the scourge of fake magicians and spiritualists. As President of the Society of American Magicians, he was keen to uphold professional standards and expose fraudulent artists.</p>

				<h3>The Legend</h3>
				<img src="images/houdini_portrait.jpg" alt="Portrait of Harry Houdini">
				<p>On October 22 of 1926, The legendary performer, whose real name was Ehrich Weiss, had a show scheduled at the Princess Theater in Montreal. Later, in his dressing room, a McGill University student, J. Gordon Whitehead (whatever happened to him?), who was reputed to be a school boxing star, asked Houdini if it were true that he could take any punch to the abdomen. Houdini was sitting on the couch half-listening, and mumbled a yes. As he stood up, Whitehead hammered 3 punches into his belly before Houdini was able to prepare for the blow.</p>

				<p>That evening and the next he continued his performances with much discomfort. He then endured a 1000-mile train ride for a 2-week engagement in Detroit, to perform at the Garrick Theater. The pain failed to subside, so he wired ahead for his manager to have a doctor waiting at the theater to examine him. Through sheer willpower, he persevered (with a 104-degree temperature) until his final act. When the curtain fell, he collapsed. He was rushed to the nearby Grace Hospital, and diagnosed with a ruptured appendix. An operation was performed, but peritonitis set in. He had one more operation, but again failed to respond. His last words were, "I am weaker. I guess I have lost the fight."</p>

				<p>On <span>Sunday October 31st</span>, Halloween day, at 1:26pm, Houdini died in room 401, Corridor D, in the old John R. Wing of Grace Hospital. He was 52 years old.</p>
